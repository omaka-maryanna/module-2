You will work on tasks covering variables, data types, loops, functions, conditionals, file handling and object-oriented programming. These fundamentals are crucial for your success in more advanced topics like data analysis, machine learning, and building applications.  \n","\n","If you find this exercise particularly challenging, itâ€™s a sign that you should revisit the learning materials and class recordings. Use this as an opportunity to strengthen your foundation before moving forward in the course.  \n","\n","Your goal is to demonstrate proficiency in Python basics by solving the provided problems effectively and writing clean, functional code.  \n","\n","## Instructions  \n","\n","- Answer the questions or complete the tasks outlined in **bold** below.  \n","- Use the specific method described if applicable.  \n","- **Important:** Do not run your code in the same cell where the answer is provided. Create a new cell below/above and write your code there.  \n","- Running code in the same cell as the answer will overwrite the provided hints and answers. Ensure you follow this structure to retain all information.  \n","\n","Good luck!  \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"anfFga-xmnAD"},"source":["**1.
